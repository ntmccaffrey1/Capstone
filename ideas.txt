Capstone Project Ideas

Fun Idea
1. Weekly Skateboard Trick Posting
   -  The idea of this site would be to post a skateboard trick weekly and users who sign up have the ability to upload videos of themselves doing the
      trick. Others user's would then like and upvote the video submissions and at the end of the week the user with the most likes/
      upvotes would win (something). This would generate a leaderboard in which users could see who has the most "points" or maybe what place
      they are in, based on how many likes or votes they get on their videos. This would utilize the Tricking API and would generate a random
      trick weekly for user's to create videos and submit them. The weekly trick posting would also be posted with a video showcasing the trick 
      from a professional or someone else that has done the trick.

2. Custom Headless Custom
   - The idea would be to build some sort of CMS that would essentially be a page builder. So the admin can create different page types just like
     a normal web CMS like Wordpress or Drupal would allow. Create dynamic blocks like hero sections, call-to-action's, header, footer, etc. This
     would require a custom built api to serve content and building out an admin panel in the backend for a logged in user to create different
     sections on their website.

Sort of Serious Idea
3. Weather App
   - Weather dashboard where you can search a city and populate the weather in a custom built UI. This would utilize the OpenWeatherMap API. Have the 
     ability to save favorite cities and produce the standard daily, 7-day, hourly forecasts and give updates when weather alerts happen. Utilize 
     different images based on weather and maybe have the ability to customize your own dashboard.
